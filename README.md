# Simple CRM

This is a [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) version of an example application generated by [Vaadin Bluemix Boilerplate](https://vaadin.com/blog/-/blogs/vaadin-boilerplate-in-bluemix).

Features of this application:

 * Responsive UI created using [Polymer elements](https://elements.polymer-project.org/) and [Vaadin Components](https://vaadin.com/components).
 * Routing between views is done using the [Page.js](https://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/) client-side router.
 * A static file is used as the data source, but it could easily be replaced with a REST API.
